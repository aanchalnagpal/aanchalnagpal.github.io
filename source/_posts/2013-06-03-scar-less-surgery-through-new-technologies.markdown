title: "Scar less surgery through new technologies"I: 16-year old Prajakta Nikam (name changed) was brought to Niramaya hospital, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, a premier 102-bed surgical hospital, with complaints of acute abdominal pain for a day.

Upon investigation, she was found to have a large ovarian tumor which had twisted on itself (torsion), and the ovary was in danger of developing gangrene. A team of doctors, headed by Dr Amit Thadhani, and Dr Anupama Sathe performed an emergency laparoscopic surgery on Prajakta, during which the tumor was removed and fortunately the ovary too, could be saved.
 The procedure was done using a state-of-art new technology known as SIMPLE (single incision multiport laparoendoscopic surgery) which made the procedure entirely scar less, as it was done through an incision concealed entirely in the umbilicus.

"Niramaya hospital has pioneered minimally invasive surgical procedures in India and has done several SIMPLE procedures which are firsts in Asia. Some of these have been done for the first time anywhere in the world", said Dr Thadhani, consulting general and laparoscopic surgeon and director, Niramaya hospital.

Prajakta has happily recovered from a major surgery with no visible marks.

Meena Vasudev (name changed), a 55 year old lady residing at Navi Mumbai, went shopping. Nothing seemed unusual, except that she had been operated just the previous day for a hernia repair using a novel technique developed by Dr Amit Thadhani. In this safe and effective technique, the scar is ingeniously hidden within the normal umbilical scar, leaving no visible marks. "This technique can be done for both umbilical hernias as well as groin hernias, but it is especially cost-effective for umbilical hernias. Usually, patients undergoing open umbilical hernia repair may require a stay of 3 to 7 days. This has been reduced to one day, which means a significant saving of cost for the patient, very quick recovery and significantly reduced pain and discomfort. It also saves up to Rs 50, 000/- in cost as compared to a laparoscopic repair, with a cosmetic outcome better than that of laparoscopic repair due to the fact that no separate openings are required beyond the umbilicus" says Dr Thadhani, who is a pioneer of several laparoscopic procedures as well. Meena is obviously extremely satisfied with the results and surprised with her quick and painless recovery.
